# Egg Friends

Parenthood is hard. You take your offspring with you to the beach, talk to them about Dostoevsky, and tackle complex issues about the state and capital before sending them off into the world as their own unique little person. That's why we created this hyper-realistic parenting simulator.

'Egg Friends' is a controversial examination of the human condition where you do something five times and get a companion. There are things to unlock, so that's cool, I guess.

This game was made in GameMaker Studio.
